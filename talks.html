<i>Sparsity of rational points on curves</i><br>
<span class="hidden">
<p>
It is a fundamental question in mathematics to find rational solutions to a given system of polynomials, and in modern language this question translates into finding rational points in algebraic varieties. This question is already very deep for algebraic curves defined over &#8474;. An intrinsic natural number associated with the curve, called its genus, plays an important role in studying the rational points on the curve. In 1983, Faltings proved the famous Mordell Conjecture (proposed in 1922), which asserts that any curve of genus at least 2 has only finitely many rational points. Thus the problem for curves of genus at least 2 can be divided into several grades: finiteness, bound, uniform bound, effectiveness. An answer to each grade requires a better understanding of the distribution of the rational points.

In my talk, I will explain the historical and recent developments of this problem according to the different grades. I will also mention an ongoing work (joint with Shouwu Zhang) about a non-vanishing property and a Northcott property of the Gross-Schoen cycles and the Ceresa cycles for curves.

<i>Xeric varieties and their relation with geometry and p-adic analysis</i><br>
<span class="hidden">
<p>General conjectures mainly due to Green, Griffiths, and Lang, predict that for a smooth projective variety <i>X</i> defined over a number field <i>K</i> the following are equivalent: 
<ol type="1">
<li>(an arithmetic condition) <i>X</i> is Mordellic, that is, for every finite extension <i>L</i>/<i>K</i> the set <i>X</i>(<i>L</i>) is finite;</li>
<li>(a geometric condition) <i>X</i> does not admit any non-constant rational maps from abelian varieties over an algebraic closure of <i>K</i>; and</li> 
<li>(an analytic condition) for some (or all) complex embedding of <i>K</i>, the variety <i>X</i> is complex hyperbolic.</li>
</ol>
We will discuss a similar conjecture regarding sparsity of rational points rather than finiteness. Namely, we say that <i>X</i> is xeric if <i>X</i>(<i>L</i>) is sparse for every finite extension <i>L</i>/<i>K</i> and we expect that the following are equivalent: 

<ol type="i">
<li>(an arithmetic condition) <i>X</i> is xeric;</li>
<li>(a geometric condition) over an algebraic closure of <i>K</i>, the variety <i>X</i> contains no rational curves; and</li>
<li>(an analytic condition) for some (or all) primes <i>p</i>, every <i>p</i>-adic analytic map from the affine line to <i>X</i> is constant.</li>
</ol>

The conjecture is motivated by earlier conjectures of Manin and Cherry. We will present several examples where the equivalences hold (at least partially) and we will discuss its relation with other general conjectures. This is joint work with Natalia Garcia-Fritz.

<i>Campana points: conjectures and results</i><br>
<span class="hidden">
<p>Campana points are an arithmetic notion, first studied by Campana and Abramovich, that interpolates between the notions of rational and integral points. Campana points are expected to satisfy suitable analogs of Mordell's conjecture, Lang's conjecture, Vojta's conjecture and Manin's conjecture, and their study introduces new number theoretic challenges of a computational nature. In this talk I introduce Campana points, recall the main results, and discuss a range of open questions.

<i>Density of rational points near manifolds</i><br>
<span class="hidden">
<p>
Given a bounded submanifold <i>M</i> in &reals;<sup><i>n</i></sup>, how many rational points with common bounded denominator are there in a small thickening of <i>M</i>? Under what conditions can we count them asymptotically as the size of the denominator goes to infinity? I will discuss some recent work in this direction and arithmetic applications such as Serre's dimension growth conjecture as well as applications in Diophantine approximation. For this I'll focus on joint work with Shuntaro Yamagishi, as well as joint work with Rajula Srivastava and Niclas Technau.

<i>Algebraic points on curves</i><br>
<span class="hidden">
<p>
The Mordell Conjecture (proved by Faltings in 1983) is a landmark result exemplifying the philosophy "Geometry controls arithmetic". However, it also implies that we can never hope to understand the arithmetic of a higher genus curve solely by studying its rational points over a fixed number field. In this talk, we will introduce the concepts of parametrized points and density degree sets and show how they, together with the Mordell-Lang conjecture, allow us to organize all algebraic points on a curve.

<i>Mordell's conjecture in positive characteristic and descent obstructions</i><br>
<span class="hidden">
<p>
I will give a brief historical overview of the Mordell conjecture over function fields of positive characteristic (mainly). Then, I'll discuss its relationship with descent obstructions for rational points and present a recent result obtained with B. Creutz, which completes my earlier work with B. Poonen, showing that finite descent obstructions fully characterize the rational points on non-isotrivial curves over function fields.

<i>On the uniform Mordell conjecture</i><br>
<span class="hidden">
<p>
In the past few years, the uniform Mordell conjecture proposed by Mazur was proved by Dimitrov-Gao-Habegger, and Kuhne, where the proof is based on Vojta's proof of the Mordell conjecture. By the theory of adelic line bundle of Yuan-Zhang, I have obtained a different proof which works over both number fields and function fields. In this talk, I will give a survey on these results.

<i>The affine case of Mordell conjecture: a survey on Siegel's theorem on integral points</i><br>
<span class="hidden">
<p>
In 1929 an epoch-making paper of Siegel offered a theorem representing the Mordell conjecture for affine curves: "A hyperbolic affine curve has only finitely many integral points" (which is a best-possible condition).
In the talk I shall briefly survey on the history of this result, pointing out some proof-approaches, extensions to higher dimensions, and related issues, like effectivity or uniform estimates for the number of solutions of diophantine equations in integers.
